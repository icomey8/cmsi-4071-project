DETAILED DESIGN DIAGRAMS:
   These diagrams are pretty good for showing the information flow in the
   system.  I particularly like the 'Entity Communication' diagram that has
   the actions labeled on the lines.

DATABASE DESIGN AND DESCRIPTION:
   This really should be an "Entity-Relationship Diagram" or "ERD".  However
   since we are close to the end of the semester, I'm not going to make you
   do this part again.  The verbal descriptions are pretty good, since you
   talk about what the entities [tables] will be.

   Here is a page with explanations and examples, in case you haven't taken
   a databases class yet:

Documentation Feedback ~ Deliverable #3
Software Development Plan
CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

WHEW!  I almost missed this because the file is named "Preliminary Schedule"
not "Software Development Plan"...  :D

INTRODUCTION/DELIVERABLES SECTION:
   This section should show not only the class deliverables, but also the
   project deliverable tasks.  They should all be intermingled so that the
   dates are consecutive.

PROJECT RESOURCES SECTION:
   Excellent job here, nothing to add.

PROJECT ORGANIZATION SECTION:
   Excellent job here, nothing to add.

PROJECT SCHEDULE SECTION:
   Excellent job here, nothing to add.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT:
   Category                          Points

   ------------------------------------------------------
   Total Percentage:   4.5/5.0 = 90% which is an A-minus

Add the task deliverables into the first section by the end of the semester
for full credit on this document.

Nice work!

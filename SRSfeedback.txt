Software Requirements Specification

CMSI 4071 Fall 2024
=======================================

COMPONENT BREAKDOWN:
   Very thorough job on this section.  Nice!

FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS:
   For an application of this size, eight requirements is not nearly enough
   to specify what you need to build.  Further, you did such a good job on
   the component identification, you should use that breakdown and specify
   at least 8 - 10 requirements FOR EACH COMPONENT.

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
   These are good performance-related items, but they need to be expressed
   in requirements language.  Beware of 'weasel words' like "smoothly" and
   "responsive" and "easily".  What is easy for you might not be for me.
   Put these into 'shall' statements and use associated 'will' statements to
   provide further detail.  For example, you have:

      5.4.3 Class Homepage Design Must Be Intuitive
            * Users must be able to navigate their class pages easily and
              intuitively

   This should be:

      5.4.3 Class Homepage
      5.4.3.1 The Class Homepage shall allow users to navigate their class
              pages with no more than two mouse clicks.
      5.4.3.2 The Class Homepage shall allow users to navigate their class
              pages in a manner that is standardized across the application.
              The standardized access will conform to the way all modern web
              pages operate.

   Try to remove any ambiguity in your language.

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS:
   Are you limiting your operation to Intel processors?  What about AMD?
   What about ARM?  What about Apple silicon M1/M2/M3?


OVERALL ASSESSMENT:

Nice work!

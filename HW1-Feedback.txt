======================

SUMMARY:
   An excellent summary, and I like that you interspersed it with personal
   thoughts that went along with the reading.  Good work on this section,
   logically laid out and well-stated.

CRITICAL THINKING:
   Relation to S/W engineering:
      Good ideas here.  I like the first one, 'nailing down the details.'
      It's so important to make sure you are giving the customer what THEY
      define as 'value', and this is not always an easy task.

      It *IS* surprising to read about the issues direct from the user, huh?

   Thoughts/opinions presented:
      Good integration of your opinions with the rest of your points in the
      essay.  Nice work!

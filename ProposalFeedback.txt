Project Proposal Feedback
Project: educational social application [no name as yet]
=========================
Proposal Document [2 points]:
Since the stated goal of your project is to demonstrate your knowledge of
full stack mobile application development, producing a "complete"
application, you should give a bit more detail about what that term means.
Also, you call this an 'educational social app' in your slides, but you
don't mention that goal in the proposal document.  However, your description
of all the technical details is VERY complete.  Your justification section
addresses the learning experience you will go through, which is good.

A couple of things to address:
   These documentation assignments are supposed to be like industry-style
   documents.  As such, you should not state the 'prompt' from the web page
   in the document.
   The phrase "analytics analysis" seems redundant.


Proposal Presentation [3 points]:
The proposal was kinda short, but the lack of slides you made up for by
talking about the project.  Questions were answered well, and clarified the
way the project will be used.


Summary:
--------
Total:  5% out of 5% for this deliverable.

Adequate job overall, and I have confidence in you as a team.

Keep up the good work!

COMMENTS
Excellent job on this preliminary document!  A couple of comments:

It looks from the diagrams like the User can maintain Discussion Lists and
not be logged in to the system.  Is this the case?

It also looks like inthe Entity Database Interactions diagram there is no
attribute for the text that goes in a discussion or a comment, although that
is really the kind of thing that would be in the detailed design section.
Still, it's a bit inconsistent.

Still, I think this is good enough as-is for the Architectural level, so you
don't need to do anything else with this section.  Full credit here.
